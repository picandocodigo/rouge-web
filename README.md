# Source code highlighter for HTML

This is a minimal web app to generate the HTML code for displaying source code with syntax highlighting. It uses [Rouge Ruby](https://github.com/rouge-ruby). You select a theme and language from the select inputs, paste/write the code in a textarea and submit. This will show the highglighted code and the HTML code that it generates which you can copy and paste wherever you like.


## Usage:

```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec ruby app.rb
```
